This program is to convert a text file into Sequence file.

For the result sequence file,
we will have key as line no,  starting from 1, and the value of the sequence file is 
the original text of the file.


For SequenceFile Writer, you either need a FSDataOutputStream or FileSystem with Path.




just start HDFS is enough
hadoop jar /home/ubuntu/workspace/SequenceFileWriter.jar /user/data.seq


hadoop fs -ls /user
drwxr-xr-x   - ubuntu supergroup          0 2016-01-06 12:39 /user/LocalToHdfs
-rw-r--r--   3 ubuntu supergroup        176 2016-01-04 05:04 /user/LocalToHdfs1
-rw-r--r--   1 ubuntu supergroup       2768 2016-01-07 02:13 /user/data.seq

hadoop fs -cat /user/data.seq
will display the encoded version, non human readable

hadoop fs -text /user/data.seq

displays (detects using the signature of the file) human readable form.

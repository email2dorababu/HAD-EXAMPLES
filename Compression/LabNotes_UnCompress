for i in {1..5000};  do  cat /etc/passwd >> passwdinput ; done

generate a sample file using the above command 

/home/ubuntu/workspace/InputData/WordCount

zip the file into tar.gz

hadoop fs -copyFromLocal passwdinput.tar.gz /user/LocalToHdfs/

hadoop fs -ls /user/LocalToHdfs/
hadoop fs -cat /user/LocalToHdfs/passwdinput.tar.gz

/user/LocalToHdfs/passwdinput.tar.gz 


The program is accepting the above path only when the configuration file is added exclusively
conf.addResource(new Path("/home/ubuntu/YARNBOX/hadoop-2.7.1/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml"));

For TAR.gz file the extension of file is TAR, and we are able to see the contents.

hadoop fs -cat /user/LocalToHdfs/passwdinput.tar

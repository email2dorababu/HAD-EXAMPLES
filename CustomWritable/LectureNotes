Custom Writables are used for counting a text pair.
this is called Bigrams

Wikipedia page for Bi-Grams

Like Word count, in Bigram(Digram) we count how many combinations of words are present?

This is very much useful in LanguageModels for speech recognition, here we use this to find what is the mostlikely the next word based on the first word.

N-Grams ( here n=2) used in probability, Communicatin theory(error correction and detection) and "data compression"

3-gram sequences are combinations of 3 words.

Other places where we need custom writables are while processing 
Logs etc.

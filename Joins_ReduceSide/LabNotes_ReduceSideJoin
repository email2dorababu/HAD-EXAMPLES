These reduce side joins are more common.
We see how to join the files used in MapSideJoins.

We can join two large data sets using reduce side joins.

The main idea is that we make sure that the joining keys are available to the reudcers.

The MR shuffle and sort does this.

For this, we need a custom writable(custom writable) to club the joining key of both data sets.


Here we reuse the BigramTextPair

to process EmpInfo, one mapper
to process Dept details another mapper

and the keys are compared in Reducer.

The below 2 steps are mandatory, else gives error.
